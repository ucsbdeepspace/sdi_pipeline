Alembic README

First make sure the database you will be working on is in the dbs folder.

To work with that database then vim into the alembic.ini file and edit the line that says "sqalchemy.url=YOURDATABSE" to = the link to your database. The link format can be seen in the current alembic.ini file or you can ask Varun for help.

When you are ready to add a revision to the database use command: 
$ alembic revisions -m "name of your revision"
This generates a new .py file in the versions folder.

Vim into this file to see the revision id. This will be next to the line that looks like 
revision = "revisionID"
You can then create your revisions to the database under the line:
def upgrade():
If you are unsure of the format used to update your databse this way you can ask Varun or look at the current test file.

When you are ready to pass this revision run the command:
$ alembic upgrade head
Head means the most recent revision. To run a different revision run:
$ alembic upgrade "revision id"

Now your database should be up to date.
If you need to go back to a past revision you can run the command:
$ alembic downgrade -1
That works for going back one revision or you can use:
$ alembic downgrade "revision id"
